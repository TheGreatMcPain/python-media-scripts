# Extract Bluray Usage

Simply run the script using a BluRay's directory as it's only argument.

Ex: `$ ./extract_bluray.py /path/to/BLURAY_FOLDER`

Repeated runs won't require suppling a BluRay directory as that information
will be read from `bluray_data.json` if found.

## Requirements

* mkvtoolnix
