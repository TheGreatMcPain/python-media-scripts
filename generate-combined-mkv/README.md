# Usage for Generate Combined MKV

Create subdirectories for each mkv file.

Within each subdirectory place an mkv file with the name `source.mkv`.

Place the script next to the subdirectories and run it.

If you make a typo in the chapter titles you can edit the `chapNames.json`
file and run the script again.  The script will see that `chapNames.json` exists
and will ask if you want to load it.
